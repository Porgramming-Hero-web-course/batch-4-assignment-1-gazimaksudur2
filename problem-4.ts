// Define a union type Circle and Rectangle, where each type has a unique shape property. Create a function calculateShapeArea that uses type guards to calculate the area based on the shape type.

// Sample Input 1:
const circleArea = calculateShapeArea({ shape: "circle", radius: 5 });

// Sample Output 1:
78.54;

// Sample Input 2:
const rectangleArea = calculateShapeArea({
  shape: "rectangle",
  width: 4,
  height: 6,
});

// Sample Output 2:
24;
