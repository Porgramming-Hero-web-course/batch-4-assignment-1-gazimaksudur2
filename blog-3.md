## Type Guards in TypeScript

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by providing static types, enabling developers to catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. However, in dynamic programming scenarios, we often work with union types or complex data structures where the type of a variable is uncertain at runtime. This is where **type guards** come in.

Type guards in TypeScript help ensure that the values we operate on have the expected structure and type, improving both safety and developer productivity. In this post, we’ll discuss why type guards are necessary and explore various types of type guards with examples to show how they work.

## Why Are Type Guards Necessary?

Type guards are essential for a few reasons:

1. **Safety**: Type guards enable developers to handle different types in a way that avoids runtime errors. They provide assurance that a variable has the expected properties before performing operations on it.

2. **Intellisense**: With type guards, TypeScript’s IntelliSense can suggest properties and methods based on the current type, making code easier to write and reducing errors.

3. **Readability**: Properly used type guards enhance the readability of code, especially when dealing with unions or intersections of types, making the developer's intent clear.

4. **Optimized Code Flow**: Type guards allow TypeScript to narrow down types within a specific block of code, optimizing the flow and potentially reducing the need for additional checks.

## Common Types of Type Guards in TypeScript

Let’s dive into some commonly used type guards and their use cases.

### 1. `typeof` Type Guard

The `typeof` operator is a basic type guard that checks primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc. It’s useful when working with union types that include primitive types.

```typescript
function printValue(value: string | number) {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
        console.log("String value:", value.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log("Number value:", value * 2);
    }
}
```
In this example, typeof value === "string" ensures value is treated as a string in that block, allowing string-specific methods like .toUpperCase().

2. instanceof Type Guard
instanceof is a type guard that checks if an object is an instance of a specific class. This is useful when dealing with class-based objects in TypeScript.

```typescript
class Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    bark() {
        console.log("Woof!");
    }
}

function speakAnimal(animal: Animal) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
        animal.bark(); // Safe to call `bark` method because animal is a Dog
    } else {
        animal.speak();
    }
}

```

The instanceof type guard verifies whether animal is a Dog, allowing us to safely call the bark method.

3. Custom Type Guard Functions
Custom type guards allow for more flexibility by checking specific properties or conditions within an object. These functions are defined with a return type in the format value is Type, which tells TypeScript that a variable has a particular type if the function returns true.


```typescript
type Bird = { fly: () => void };
type Fish = { swim: () => void };

function isBird(animal: Bird | Fish): animal is Bird {
    return (animal as Bird).fly !== undefined;
}

function makeItFly(animal: Bird | Fish) {
    if (isBird(animal)) {
        animal.fly(); // Safe to call `fly` because it's confirmed as Bird
    } else {
        console.log("This animal can't fly.");
    }
}

```

Here, the isBird function is a custom type guard that checks for the fly method to determine if the animal is of type Bird.

4. in Type Guard
The in operator checks if a specified property exists within an object, making it particularly useful for objects with optional properties or union types.


```typescript
type Car = { drive: () => void };
type Boat = { sail: () => void };

function operateVehicle(vehicle: Car | Boat) {
    if ("drive" in vehicle) {
        vehicle.drive(); // Safe to call `drive` because it's confirmed as Car
    } else {
        vehicle.sail(); // Otherwise, vehicle is of type Boat
    }
}

```

The in operator here checks if drive exists in vehicle, confirming its type as Car.

5. discriminated unions Type Guard
Discriminated unions are a type guard approach using a common property (usually called a “tag” or “discriminant”) to differentiate between multiple types in a union. This is especially common with complex objects that need differentiation based on their properties.


```typescript
type Circle = { shape: "circle"; radius: number };
type Rectangle = { shape: "rectangle"; width: number; height: number };

function calculateArea(shape: Circle | Rectangle) {
    if (shape.shape === "circle") {
        return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    } else {
        return shape.width * shape.height;
    }
}

```

Here, the shape property acts as a discriminant that lets TypeScript infer whether shape is a Circle or a Rectangle.

When to Use Type Guards
Union Types: Whenever you have union types, type guards help narrow down which type is currently in use, allowing for safe property access.
Error Prevention: Type guards prevent runtime errors by ensuring the expected type is present before performing operations.
Complex Logic Handling: With complex data structures and unions, type guards enable clear and efficient handling of different types.
Enhanced Readability: Code becomes easier to understand by clarifying which type is being operated on within a certain scope.
Conclusion
Type guards are an invaluable feature in TypeScript, ensuring that variables hold the types we expect at runtime. By utilizing typeof, instanceof, in, custom type guards, and discriminated unions, TypeScript developers can handle union types and complex structures with ease and confidence. Type guards not only provide type safety but also improve code readability, error prevention, and IntelliSense support, making them a crucial aspect of writing robust TypeScript applications.
